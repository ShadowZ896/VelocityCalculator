# VelocityCalculator

In order to get more familiar with GitHub and also to challenge my programming skills,
I decided to build this application that gives the derivitive of a velocity problem back to
the user via lexical anaylsis, not unlike how a compiler processes code and turns it into 
something humans can read.

While I understand just fulfilling the mathematical part of this would have been far easier to
do in Python given it's flurry of math libraries and tools, that to me seemed to easy. I wanted to
make it so that I didn't have "magical" tools and my dispoal and that I fully understood what I was
creating with this project.

Also, I'm using C++. So in the "O(case)" it should at least be faster than if I had done it using
Python. 😎
